# IOT based Garbage Monitoring System and Domestic Care

In this project, a model is being made to overcome the problems of garbage monitoring, management and segregation. The system uses ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04), a servo motor, moisture sensor, an IR sensor and LED which are connected to NodeMCU ESP-12E. Data from each measuring system and segregater is sent to MySQL database. The data is stored in form of a table which is later retrived and displayed in a [webpage](https://iotgarbagemonitoringsystem.000webhostapp.com/).
